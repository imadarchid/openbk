Extraction
----------

To extract data from a PDF statement:

.. code-block:: python

    from openbk.extract import extract
    output = extract("path/to/your/file.pdf")

    print(output) # Show the output

The output of the ``extract()`` method is a list that comprises the following:
1. ``beg_balance``: Beginning balance of the month corresponding to that statement.
2. ``end_balance``: Ending balance of the month corresponding to that statement.
3. ``transactions``: Dataframe object with **transaction**, **debit**, **credit**, and **date** columns.

You can find the explanation of each column below:

* **transaction**: refers the transaction text (Libell√©). It describes the operation.
* **debit**: refers to the debited amount (expense) for transactions where applicable.
* **credit**: refers to the credited amount (revenue) for transactions where applicable.
* **date**: refers to the date of the transaction.

**The ``transactions`` object [2] is also used for all subsequent methods**
